# MovieRating
iOS app to scan movie barcode and get IMDB, Rotten Tomato, and MetaScore ratings.

## Use Case
MovieRating was created to solve the following problem. I'm picky about the movies I watch. When I got to the library to get a movie, I want one the scored at least a 6 or above on IMDB's scale. The way I used to handle this was to do a search on the IMDB app for every movie I looked at. Now, all I have to do is scan the barcode and I immediately get color-coded feedback on whether the movie meets my stringent requirements as well as links to the IMDB and RottenTomatoes
